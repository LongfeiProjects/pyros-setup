    :target: https://travis-ci.org/asmodehn/pyros-setup

Toolsuite for running ROS environments directly from python code, without any specific requirements outside of usual python.

This is a pure python package, to be installed in your system, in order to allow easy ROS access from your python environment. 

To install it::

sudo pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi pyros_setup

However it is usable from source for ease of development and compatibility testing.
Just use the branch matching your rosdistro.
